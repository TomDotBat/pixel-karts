# üìã Description

**PIXEL Karts** is a unique, feature rich vehicle system tailored specifically towards karts. It comes with a wide variety of new, fun and configurable features that your players will love. PIXEL Karts takes all of the existing vehicle systems' features and packs it into one big and polished package, so you don't have to bother buying additional scripts such as VCMod or a car dealer.


# ‚ú® Features
- A custom selling/customisation system built inside of a garage you can set up anywhere in your map. No car dealer required.
- Donator specific prices, let your VIPs pay less for customisations and more!
- Kart upgrades such as: rocket booster, glider, underglow, passenger seat, rainbow colour, custom logos, built in radio and more!
- Donator restricted upgrades, give more reasons for your players to donate to your server!

# üîß Installation
1. Download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/TomDotBat/pixel-karts/releases/latest).
2. Download the latest copy of [PIXEL UI](https://github.com/TomDotBat/pixel-ui/releases/latest) from its GitHub releases.
3. Extract the zip files using your preferred ZIP extraction software (eg: [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) or [7-ZIP](https://www.7-zip.org/)).
4. Drag & drop the folders into your addon's folder. **Ensure the addon folder and file names don't contain capital letters, otherwise it may fail to load on Linux servers!**
5. Configure the addon by changing the config files in `lua/pixelkarts/config/`. The files you'll need to change are: `sh_rank_levels.lua`, `sh_upgrades.lua`, `sh_miscellaneous.lua` and `sv_database.lua` (preferably in that order). If your map is not supported (see supported maps section), you are able to set up a config for it in the maps folder.
